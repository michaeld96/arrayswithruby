#2) Get data after the the installation was in. 12 months.
#3) How much it cost for the upgrade.
#---------------------------------------------------------
#Operations:
#1) Get all data for 12 months. Use a loop to get all data.
#2) Get all data after the months.
#3) Display the data before the installation.
#4) Display the data after the installation. (From greatest to lowest)
#5) Show how long it will take to break even.
